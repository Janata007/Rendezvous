# Rendezvous React Frontend App

## Authors: Jana Markovikj, Marko Markovikj, Bojan Dabevski

This is a project made for course purposes. It is a Spring application made using JPA entities managed by rest controllers and portrayed on the frontend using React. It mimicks the behavior of the already well known Tinder app and serves solely as a way for us to rack up some points this semester.
